## USB AUTORUN


</div>

### Description

This program should be put into the STARTUP folder. It looks to see if a USB Flash Drive has just been inserted and executes the program in the AUTORUN.INF file.

In other words, it enables the CD Style autorun.

No changes are made to the registry and apart from a timer object, it has a very low overhead.
 
### More Info
 
The autorun.inf is simply written in the standard format.

No returns... it simply autoruns any program referenced in the Autorun.inf on a USB Flash Drive just as though it were a CD.

The source code is freely distributable

### API Declarations

No API usage. I used the DIR command instead to keep the overheads down.
